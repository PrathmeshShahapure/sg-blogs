### You can’t govern what you can’t control

<a href="https://www.stackguard.io/blog/Securing-the-Silent-Majority"><u>**Discovery**</u></a> identifies the problem. <a href="https://www.stackguard.io/blog/NHI-Remediation-and-Risk-Management"><u>**Remediation**</u></a> fixes it. Governance ensures it does not happen again.

Machine identities now outnumber human users by up to 95:1. Their privileges often exceed those of senior executives. Recent evidence reinforces the scale of the problem, and its urgency:

- <a href="https://www.silverfort.com/blog/insecurity-in-the-shadows-the-data-that-proves-why-non-human-identities-are-a-cybersecurity-priority/"><u>**Only 5.7%**</u></a> of organizations claim to accurately inventory all NHIs
- <a href="https://www.itpro.com/security/identity-security-is-more-important-than-ever-heres-why"><u>**Only 10%**</u></a> of organizations have a mature governance strategy for NHIs
- <a href="https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/artifacts/state-of-non-human-identity-security-survey-report"><u>**Only 20%**</u></a> of organizations have formal processes for offboarding and revoking API keys
- <a href="https://www.itpro.com/security/identity-security-is-more-important-than-ever-heres-why"><u>**Less than one third**</u></a> of all organizations apply the same rigor to machine identities as they do to human accounts
- <a href="https://www.cyberark.com/resources/ebooks/identity-security-threat-landscape-2024-report"><u>**93%**</u></a> of organizations had two or more identity-related breaches in 2023

And it shows. In early 2025, a global technology company disclosed a breach where attackers leveraged an orphaned service account with excessive API privileges to access confidential customer data. The account had survived three cloud migrations without review - a governance lapse of epic proportions, and yet exceedingly common. 

### Challenges of NHI governance

Governance sounds simple on slides. In practice, it is anything but. Consider just three of the greatest challenges:

- **Scale and ephemerality**: NHIs can number in the tens of thousands, with new ones appearing and vanishing in seconds.


- **Fragmented ownership**: DevOps, security, and compliance teams each assume someone else is enforcing policy - while attackers thank them for their collaboration.


- **Legacy constraints**: Older applications typically resist integration with governance frameworks, creating shadow zones and blind spots of unmanaged risk. It’s all too common to have access tokens and API keys floating around years after the applications have been decommissioned. 

### Building a governance framework that works
A holistic governance strategy must balance security, operational agility, and compliance. GRC often has a notorious reputation of obstructing business workflows and impeding company operations. Yet, with the right strategy and the right tools, it is possible to build a robust GRC framework that acts as a business driver rather than just a point solution to a point problem. 

Best practices for comprehensive NHI GRC posture can be divided roughly into four categories:

    1. Lifecycle management
    2. Scalable policy enforcement
    3. Behavioral monitoring and anomaly detection
    4. Compliance and audit-readiness

#### Lifecycle management
Automated provisioning and deprovisioning policies must be non-negotiable. Every machine identity should have a defined start and end date, tied to its application or workload lifecycle. 

- **Automate retirement**: Link NHI expiration to the decommissioning of workloads and applications. No identity should survive its use case.

- **Mandate expiry dates**: All tokens and credentials must expire by default. Manual overrides should require explicit approval and justification.

- **Audit trails**: Ensure complete logs of creation, modification, and deletion events for every NHI to satisfy compliance and incident forensics.

### Policy enforcement at scale 
Policies must apply consistently across all environments - on-premise, multi-cloud, and hybrid. Governance must operate in real time and be integrated seamlessly into the software development cycle. Moreover, NHI management and security tools must be deployed locally to keep data within the organizational network. 

- **Automated policy engines**: Use automation to enforce least privilege, rotation, and tagging policies globally.

- **CI/CD integration**: Embed compliance checks into development pipelines to catch violations before deployment.

- **Integration with third-party services**: In today’s flat and automated world, 

- **Continuous validation**: Perform real-time validation of privilege assignments against policy baselines.

Governance includes not just the formulation of policies, but also the ability to enforce them. Without enforcement, policies by themselves are useless. For example, even though your prescribed policy might forbid hardcoded secrets, your actual codebase disagrees, thus rendering the policy powerless. 

### Behavioral monitoring and anomaly detection 

After enforcement comes monitoring. Static governance controls are not enough - modern-day complexities demand dynamic governance. Continuous behavioral visibility ensures that when an NHI acts abnormally, security teams know immediately.

- **Behavioral baselines**: Establish expected baseline activity patterns for each identity. Anything outside that range triggers an escalation and a review.

- **Real-Time analytics**: Leverage AI-driven anomaly detection to identify credential misuse or over-privileged access.

- **Integration with SIEM/SOAR**: Feed identity telemetry into broader security operations for rapid incident response and broader analytics

In 2025, a healthcare provider detected an anomaly when a service account designed for database backup attempted to exfiltrate data at 2 AM. Governance combined with real-time analytics stopped the breach within minutes.

### Compliance and audit readiness 

The last step is to turn governance into evidence. Regulatory frameworks such as GDPR, HIPAA, and SOC 2 demand proof of control. Regulators, auditors, and customers no longer accept merely the existence of policies, but demand evidence of their enforcement. Good governance isn’t only about having the right processes, it’s about being able to generate audit-ready evidence on demand.

- **Centralized logging**: Aggregate identity activity across all systems into a single source of truth. Without centralization, logs are scattered across cloud accounts and systems, making investigations and audits painfully slow and stressful. 

- **Policy-to-control mapping**: Demonstrate how technical controls enforce governance requirements. Mapping means being able to point from “our policy says no hardcoded secrets” to “here is the evidence that proves our codebase has no hardcoded secrets”.

- **Automated reporting**: Produce evidence for auditors without manual intervention - because manual equals margin for error. Automated reporting allows you to produce compliance evidence at the push of a button (e.g. dashboards, privilege summaries, exception logs), dramatically reducing cost and risk. 

Governance is a team effort, and the collective responsibility of teams across the IT and Audit departments.

### Governance as the Great Differentiator
Governance is the third act that makes discovery and remediation sustainable. In a world where machine identities multiply exponentially, governance will define the winners and the cautionary tales. 

If executed correctly, governance can be a competitive business differentiator. Studies show that organizations adopting a unified approach experience a 47% reduction in identity-related security incidents and a 62% improvement in incident response time. 

Investors and regulators alike are beginning to scrutinize identity governance as a reliable indicator of organizational maturity and overall cybersecurity posture.

NHIs may not speak, but their absence in your governance strategy will echo loudly in regulatory hearings and shareholder meetings. Secure them before they secure your downfall.
